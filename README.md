# How to index new encoded texts and lemmatised words?

From the command line:

```
cp fr_tokenised.xml royal_tokenised.xml kiln_out/prepared/.
cp kwic-out.xml kiln_out/received/.

./manage.py rebuild_index
```

Where fr_tokenised.xml and royal_tokenised.xml are generated by [kiln-tvof scripts](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/tvof-kiln#scripts) and kwic-out is the output file from Lemming.

Note: please make sure the tokenised files match the lemmatised output, i.e. it should be the tokenised files generated alongside the most recent kwic-in.xml uploaded to Lemming.
